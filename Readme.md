# DALHOUSINGEASE

## VERIFIED HOMES, PEACE OF MIND!

DalHousingEase makes renting property easier. This marketplace brings landlords and tenants together on one platform. It uses new technology to give users a smooth experience.

The backend of DalHousingEase uses Java with Spring Boot and JPA. This combo creates strong ready-for-use applications that handle data well. JWT (JSON Web Token) keeps users safe by making sure each login stays secure. React.js powers the frontend giving users a lively and quick-to-respond interface. The app looks good and works well on all devices thanks to CSS, Tailwind, and Bootstrap. These tools help create a fresh easy-to-use design.

MySQL makes data management easier, and Cloudinary takes care of storing images, which simplifies handling media. The project aims to keep code easy to maintain and high in quality by using Lombok to cut down on repetitive code, ModelMapper to map objects well, and JUnit and Mockito to test units and achieve TDD in the development cycles.

Besides being easy to use, DalHousingEase stands out because it cares about quality. An admin checks every property listed on the site, and a tag shows it's been verified next to the property details. This means tenants see the most real and trustworthy listings. And also it offers a direct chat opportunity with the property Lister about listing and its details which makes renting both fun and reliable.
